PSX X-Men Mutant Academy - WAD Console Tool - 0.1

What is it:
Console only tool that can unpack and repack PSX X-MEN Mutant Academy WAD.WAD file.

How to unpack:
Put XMMA_WADConsole.exe near WAD.WAD (presumably extracted from cd image).
Use "XMMA_WADConsole.exe WAD.WAD" in console/terminal.

It detaches the header into wadhead.hed and unpacks binary files into WADdata.

How to pack:
Use "XMMA_WADConsole.exe wadhead.hed" in console/terminal.

It combines all of that back into WADnew.WAD that you can rename/move to wherever it needs to go.

Yes, you should be able to replace files and add new ones.
Probably can work with MA2 as well, but not guaranteed.

Provided as is.
